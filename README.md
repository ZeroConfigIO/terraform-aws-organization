#### Dev Dependencies

##### Pre-Commit

###### Installation

Before you can run hooks, you need to have the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) package manager installed.

Using pip:

```
pip install pre-commit
```

In a python project, add the following to your requirements.txt (or requirements-dev.txt):

```
pre-commit
```

Using homebrew:

```
brew install pre-commit
```

###### Install the git hook scripts

Run pre-commit install to set up the git hook scripts

```
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

now `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`!

###### (optional) Run against all the files

it's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks (usually pre-commit will only run on the changed files during git hooks)

```
$ pre-commit run -a
```
